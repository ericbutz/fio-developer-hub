linkauth

Overview

linkauth allows secondary account to execute a specific action on behalf of the primary account. For example if Account Domain Owner owns a domain and that domain is private, it can authorize Account Registrar to register FIO Addresses on that domain, without making it public. Here’s an example of how this can be acomplished.

Add new permission

First start by adding a new permission, let’s call it regaddress, to the account which owns the domain.

{
	"account": "eosio",
	"name": "updateauth",
	"authorization": [{
			"actor": "account_name_of_domain_owner",
			"permission": "active"
		}
	],
	"data":
	{
		"account": "account_name_of_domain_owner",
		"permission": "regaddress",
		"parent": "active",
		"auth": {
			"threshold": 1,
			"keys": [],
			"waits": [],
			"accounts": [{
					"permission": {
						"actor": "account_name_of_registrar",
						"permission": "active"
					},
					"weight": 1
				}
			]
		},
		"max_fee": 1000000000
	}

}
Link the new permission

Once the new permission is created, we link it to the Register FIO Address action.

{
	"account": "eosio",
	"name": "linkauth",
	"authorization": [{
			"actor": "account_name_of_domain_owner",
			"permission": "active"
		}
	],
	"data": {
		"account": "account_name_of_domain_owner",
		"code": "fio.address",
		"type": "regaddress",
		"requirement": "regaddress",
		"max_fee": 1000000000
	}

}
Register FIO Address on behalf of owner

You can now register FIO Address, but you have to do so with the owner’s actor and the new permission as authorization and signature of the active permission of registrar.

{
	"account": "fio.address",
	"name": "regaddress",
	"authorization": [{
			"actor": "account_name_of_domain_owner",
			"permission": "regaddress"
		}
	],
	"data": {
		"fio_address": "bob@privatedomain",
		"owner_fio_public_key": "",
		"max_fee": 40000000000,
		"tpid": "",
		"actor": "account_name_of_domain_owner"
	}
}
