Resource management

Overview

The FIO Chain inherits EOSIO resource management, but makes a number of modifications to it to remove the user complexity, while supporting its fee model.

Staking

FIO Chain does not support staking.

RAM limits

Every new account will have initial RAM allocated to 25600 bytes (25K). Every time an account pays a fee or covers a transaction from a bundle, that accountâ€™s RAM will be permanently increased by the number associated with the executed action. In case of multi-action transactions, each action will increment the RAM independently.

Action	Increase amount in bytes
REGDOMAIN	2,560
REGADDRESS	2,560
ADDADDRESS	512
SETDOMPUB	256
NEWFUNDSREQUEST	2,048
RECORDOBT	2,048
RENEWADDRESS	1,024
RENEWDOMAIN	1,024
TRNSPBKY	1,024
REJECTFUNDS	512
LINKAUTH	1,024
REGPRODUCER	1,024
REGPROXY	1,024
VOTEPROXY	512
VOTEPRODUCER	1,024
UPDATEAUTH	1,024 per 1,000 bytes of trx size
PROPOSE	1,024 per 1,000 bytes of trx size
APPROVE	1,024
XFERDOMAIN	512
XFERADDRESS	512
Example

Account A registers a FIO Address for themselves and pays a 40 FIO fee
Account A RAM is increased by 2,560 bytes
Account A transfers funds to a key not associated with an account
Account A RAM is increased by 2,560 bytes
Account B is created with initial limit of 25KB of RAM
Scheduled BP RAM override

When a BP is added to the BP schedule to produce blocks, their RAM limit will be changed to unlimited
When a BP is removed from BP schedule, their RAM will be changed to existing RAM usage of their account + 25K
Transaction size limit

Every transaction is limited to max size of 8098 bytes. BPs in schedule as exempt from the transaction limit for propose action.

CPU limit

All accounts are created with unlimited CPU, as only authorized contracts with pre-approved CPU usage can run on the FIO Chain.

NET limit

All accounts are created with unlimited NET, as there is a transaction size limit.
