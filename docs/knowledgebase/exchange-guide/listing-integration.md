FIO token transfer transactions

FIO token

FIO Chain’s native token is FIO. FIO is the only token present on the FIO Chain.

There are 1,000,000,000 Smallest Units of FIO (SUFs) inside 1 FIO. All transactions in FIO Protocol are expressed in SUFs.

Ticker: FIO
Symbol: ᵮ
Brand Assets
Transferring FIO token

Tokens on the FIO Chain are transferred using /transfer_tokens_pub_key method.

The method requires payee FIO Public Key. The key is hashed down to an account name and funds are transferred to that account. If that account does not exist, it gets created automatically.

The native EOSIO transfer action is not supported.

Checking token balance

Token balance can be obtained by passing FIO Public Key to /get_fio_balance API method.

Transaction history

See History node

Transaction memo

/transfer_tokens_pub_key does not accept a memo field. To attach a memo to a FIO token transfer, both payer and payee must have a FIO Address. See FIO integration.

TPID

Do not forget to include your TPID in the request to earn portion of fees paid.
Handling FIO token deposits

Using unique FIO Public Key

Similar to UTXO-based chains, to accept FIO token deposit, an exchange may generate a unique FIO Public Key for every user or deposit. Unlike EOSIO, FIO Chain does not require that key to be assigned to an existing account before funds are sent to it. Once a token transfer is initiated to that Public Key, the account will be created automatically.

FIO Chain’s is registered at index 235/0x800000eb on the SLIP-44.

FIO Private Keys follow standard Wallet Import Format (WIF) standard and public keys follow well-known base58 encoding with FIO prefix, e.g.

FIO7tkpmicyK2YWShSKef6B9XXqBN6LpDJo69oRDfhn67CEnj3L2G

For those who have integrated EOSIO, FIO public keys follows the same format, except the prefix is FIO instead of EOS.

FIO Key Derivation Path:

"44'/235'/0'/0/0"

See Private/Public Keys for more information including testing examples.

Using FIO Address or FIO Request

See FIO integration.

Recognizing deposits when using unique FIO Public Key

When using unique FIO Public Key for deposits, you can look for trnsfiopubky transaction with target payee_public_key in every block. You can get transactions in every block by running /get_block at every block height.

trnsfiopubky via Multisig

It is important to note that /get_block will not return trnsfiopubky transaction if it was executed as part of Multisig as that transaction is executed via inline contract actions and only shows up as inline trace, which are not returned by /get_block.

In order to properly recognize transfers made using Multisig you should monitor /get_block for executed transaction status:

"transactions": [   {
      "status": "executed",
      "cpu_usage_us": 7929,
      "net_usage_words": 0,
      "trx": "fa206c2e47af50873dfe08a03802918113c1832e3f42b26e1b20ad77b66ccf20"
   }]
and then fetch inline traces using /v1/history/get_transaction and returned trx. This requires History node.

See more details on Community Discussion Page.
Handling FIO token withdrawals

Using FIO Public Key

With this option, the user’s withdrawal area on the exchange would ask for a FIO Public Key and the amount of withdrawals. The transfer would be executed using /transfer_tokens_pub_key and metadata recorded using /record_obt_data.

Using FIO Address or FIO Request

See FIO integration.
Obtaining token supply in real-time

The Foundation operates API end-point which returns token supply statistics, specifically:

Statistic	Description	End-point
Total supply	All tokens that were ever minted. Maximum token supply is capped at 1,000,000,000 FIO.	https://fioprotocol.io/supply
Circulating supply	Total supply less locked tokens.	https://fioprotocol.io/circulating
Locked tokens	Tokens which are locked and cannot be transferred.	https://fioprotocol.io/locked
Data returned includes 9 decimal points, e.g. 705906876.848960519

To return data in Smallest Units of FIO (SUFs), add /suf to end point, e.g. https://fioprotocol.io/supply/suf

To return the data as json, add ?json=true top end point, e.g. https://fioprotocol.io/supply?json=true
